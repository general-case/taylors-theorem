Markup is the default mode but you can explicitly enter markup mode by surrounding the content with square brackets.

If a math expression inside the $ $ delimiters is surrounded by spaces then the expression is typeset in display (block) mode.
Otherwise, the expression is typeset in line mode.

In code mode, curly braces are used to define a code block.

Code that needs to access contextual data, such as heading numbers, page numbers, equation numbers, etc, must run inside a context aware
expression or code block introduced by the #context keyword. This requirement appears to be due to some kind of implementation detail.

The @preview namespace on the import statement refers to the namespace for community contributed packages.

Labels are enclosed in angle brackets, e.g. <sec:my_section>, and referenced using the @ notation, e.g. @sec:my_section.

The show statement works like a CSS rule with a selector followed by styling.
The show keyword followed by a selector and style are called a show rule.
A show rule with a blank selector applies the styling every element in the document from the point of invocation.
When a function is used as a show rule style, it is applied to each matching element, in a manner analogous to the visitor pattern.

The let statement allows you to introduce a variable and assign a value to it or define a function.

Content may be placed in square brackets following a function call. This construct is called a trailing content block.

The argument spreading operator .. converts an array to a sequence of positional arguments.
Functions like table and grid take data as a sequence of positional arguments rather than an array.

Work in progress!\
Taylor's theorem is one of the most important in all of mathematics and truly understanding it means that you have achieved
a significant level of _mathematical maturity_, but it can be challenging to find an explanation of the theorem in plain language.
Taylor's theorem has enormous practical value. In fact, it is the theorem that provides the underlying algorithm that your
calculator uses to almost instantly compute the values of functions such as sine, cosine, and the exponential function ($e^x$).
In this paper, I'll present a somewhat informal account of what Taylor's theorem actually is, and why it is useful for calculating the 
values of functions. On our journey to understanding Taylor's theorem we'll take a look a prerequisite objects such as
polynomials, power series, Taylor polynomials, and the Taylor series.
We'll conclude with a look at how Taylor's theorem is used to define the sine function from scratch, mathematically rather than
geometrically.

= Introduction <sec:introduction>

What will you need to understand this paper?
Well, you'll need to be familiar with the real numbers, have a good grasp of what a function is
and know a couple of different types of functions, like real-valued functions over the reals (aka real functions) and functions over the natural numbers.
You'll also need a basic understanding of calculus, at least to the point where you know what a derivative is and what an integral is.
It would be helpful if you've solved a quadratic equation or two.
First-year college or AP highschool mathematics should be more than enough.

When writing an _accessible_ paper on a topic it's hard to know how far back to go explaining the basic principles.
Too much of this can result in endless backtracking where the main topic of the paper becomes lost in a sea of basic ideas, but too little
risks not setting the stage sufficiently so that the reader can understand the core ideas with ease.

In this paper, I'll try to strike a balance by briefly laying out some basic mathematical ideas that can be covered in just a page or two,
without presenting an entire treatise on predicate logic.

We'll begin by laying out all of our mathematical equipment on our workbench, so to speak, and look at each part to understand
what it is and how it works.

= Mathematical preliminaries

Let's begin with a lightning tour of some useful mathematical concepts.
In this section, there'll be a lot of statements like _there are only two of blah_ or _there is only one something or other_.
You can think of statements like these as _intellectual handholds_ that you can literally, no metaphorically
#text(emoji.face.smile.slight, 8pt),
grab on to as you scale the heights of the mathematical edifice.
They express ideas that you can _take to the bank_, that you can always count on.

Also, you should know that mathematics is often written in an informal but highly stylized language, but for each piece of informal
language there is a formal counterpart that sometimes looks a bit like computer code (especially the way I write it).
I'll introduce the formal notation first because it is more precise and can actually be easier to understand.


== Objects

Mathematics is all about objects: natural numbers, real numbers, functions, vectors, matrices, perfectoid spaces, and on and on.

== Statements


== Quantifiers

Before we look at the objects that are directly related to Taylor's theorem, let's briefly talk about the most important piece of
mathematical machinery that you've (probably) never heard of, _quantifiers_.
Stated simply, all mathematical variables (which are sometimes called "indeterminates") are introduced by quantifiers.
There are only two quantifiers, the universal quantifier, represented by the symbol $forall$,
and the existential quantifier, represented by the symbol $exists$.
Quantifiers tell you which letters, or possibly words or symbols, are being used as variables in a given mathematical statement,
and very importantly they tell you the _type_ of the variable, that is the type of number or object that the variable can contain.
Also, quantifiers tell you the role of the variable as it relates to the truth of the statement.
The universal quantifier tells you that the statement must be true for all values of the variable.
The existential quantifier tells you that the statement must be true for at least one value of the variable.
If the quantified statement does not meet these conditions then the statement is false.

Predicate logic represents the place where the _logical rubber meets the mathematical road_.

= Euler's solution to the Basel problem <sec:solution>

Euler solved the Basel problem by proving the following theorem.

#theorem(title: "Basel problem")[$ sum_(n=1)^oo 1/n^2 = pi^2/6 $] <thm:basel_problem>

== Proof

The sine function is defined analytically by the Maclaurin series

$ sin x = x - x^3/3! + x^5/5! - x^7/7! + dots.c . $ <eq:maclaurin_series_for_sin>

Maclaurin series are a special type of power series.
Since polynomial functions — which, by definition, contain only finitely many terms — can also be viewed as finite power series,
Euler reasoned that the Maclaurin series for the sine function could be manipulated in much the same way as a polynomial.
In particular, he treated it as though it could be factorized into a constant multiplied by infinitely many linear factors.
Although this approach was controversial at the time, it was later placed on a firm mathematical foundation
with the publication of Karl Weierstrass’s factorization theorem in 1876.

Polynomial functions may be re-expressed via factorization
as the product of a constant, a finite number of real linear factors, and a finite number of irreducible real quadratics.
The irreducible real quadratics appear only when the polynomial function has one or more non-real, complex zeros.
If the polynomial has all real zeros, then it can be expressed solely as the product of a constant and a finite number real linear factors. \
For example, the polynomial function $f(x) = 2x^2 - 14x + 24$, which has real zeros 3 and 4, may be expressed as $f(x) = 2(x-3)(x-4)$.
In the polynomial case, the constant is simply the leading coefficient, i.e., the coefficient of the highest degree term.
In the case of power series however, since there are infinitely many terms, there is no _highest degree term_ and thus no leading coefficient.
The constant is still part of the factorization of the power series; it's just that we can't determine it by looking at the highest
degree term and we need to use a different technique to extract it, as we'll see later in the argument.

Since $sin x$ is zero _only_ at $x=0, plus.minus pi, plus.minus 2pi, plus.minus 3pi, dots$, these values are the zeros of the Maclaurin series.
Note that since the zeros have the form $plus.minus k pi$ for all $k in NN$ and are thus all real,
the series can be expressed as the product of a constant $c$ and infinitely many real linear factors of \
the form $(x plus.minus k pi)$.
It is these zeros that explain why $pi$ appears in the value of the Basel sum.

#pagebreak()

Thus, we have

$ sin x = c (x-0)(x-pi)(x+pi)(x-2pi)(x+2pi)(x-3pi)(x+3pi) dots.c $
$ sin x = c x(x-pi)(x+pi)(x-2pi)(x+2pi)(x-3pi)(x+3pi) dots.c $
$ (sin x)/x = c (x-pi)(x+pi)(x-2pi)(x+2pi)(x-3pi)(x+3pi) dots.c $
$ (sin x)/x = c (x^2 - pi^2)(x^2 - 4pi^2)(x^2 - 9pi^2 ) dots.c wide "(difference of squares)," $ <eq:diff_of_squares>

for some constant $c$.

The next step is to determine the value of the constant $c$. \
At $x=0$, $(sin x)/x = 0/0$, which is undefined, but in the context of limits $0/0$ is an indeterminate form,
so we are permitted to take the limit of both sides as $x$ goes to zero.
Taking the limit we get

$ lim_(x->0) (sin x)/x = lim_(x->0) c (x^2 - pi^2)(x^2 - 4pi^2)(x^2 - 9pi^2 ) dots.c . $

The limit of the left side is simply 1, i.e., $lim_(x->0) (sin x)/x = 1$,
which can be verified through a simple application of L'Hospital's rule.
Thus, we have

$ 1 = c (- pi^2)(- 4pi^2)(- 9pi^2) dots.c $
$ c = 1 / ((- pi^2)(- 4pi^2)(- 9pi^2) dots.c) $
$ c = (1 / (- pi^2)) (1 / (- 4pi^2)) (1 / (- 9pi^2)) dots.c . $

Pairing each factor of $c$ with its matching difference of squares factor from @eq:diff_of_squares, we get

$ (sin x)/x = (1 / (- pi^2))(x^2 - pi^2) (1 / (- 4pi^2))(x^2 - 4pi^2) (1 / (- 9pi^2))(x^2 - 9pi^2 ) dots.c $
$ (sin x)/x = (1-x^2/(pi^2)) (1-x^2/(4pi^2)) (1-x^2/(9pi^2)) dots.c . $ <eq:weierstrass>

As a brief aside, we should note that @eq:weierstrass is equivalent to Weierstrass's factorization of $sin x$.

$ sin x = x product_(n=1)^oo [1-x^2/(n^2 pi^2)] wide "Weierstrass factorization" $

#pagebreak()

Indeed, we could have used Weierstrass as our starting point for the proof.
However, since we are following Euler's development of the argument, we chose to begin with the Maclaurin series for sine.

If we progressively FOIL a number of factors of the infinite product on the right-hand side of @eq:weierstrass from left to right we get

$ (1-x^2/(pi^2)) (1-x^2/(4pi^2)) (1-x^2/(9pi^2)) $ <exp:foil_1>
$ (1-x^2/(pi^2) - x^2/(4pi^2) + x^4/(4pi^4)) (1-x^2/(9pi^2)) $ <exp:foil_2>
$ (1-x^2/(pi^2) - x^2/(4pi^2) + x^4/(4pi^4) - x^2/(9pi^2) + x^4/(9pi^4) + x^4/(36pi^4) - x^6/(36pi^6)) . $ <exp:foil_3>

Regrouping @exp:foil_3[expression] so that the matching terms are adjacent, we get

$ 1-x^2/(pi^2) - x^2/(4pi^2) - x^2/(9pi^2) + x^4/(4pi^4) + x^4/(9pi^4) + x^4/(36pi^4) - x^6/(36pi^6) $
$ 1 - (x^2/(pi^2) + x^2/(4pi^2) + x^2/(9pi^2)) + (x^4/(4pi^4) + x^4/(9pi^4) + x^4/(36pi^4)) - (x^6/(36pi^6)) $
$ 1 - x^2/pi^2(1/1 + 1/4 + 1/9) + x^4/pi^4(1/4 + 1/9 + 1/36) - x^6/pi^6(1/36) . $

Continuing this process indefinitely, we end up with a sum of the form

$
1 -
x^2/pi^2(1/1 + 1/4 + 1/9 + dots.c) +
x^4/pi^4(1/4 + 1/9 + 1/36 + dots.c) -
x^6/pi^6(1/36 + dots.c) +
dots.c .
$ <exp:foil_infinite>

We'll set $S_2, S_4, "and" S_6$ equal to the sums in the $x^2, x^4, "and" x^6$ terms respectively.\
We'll set $C_2, C_4, "and" C_6$ equal to the coefficients of the $x^2, x^4, "and" x^6$ terms respectively,\
such that $C_2 = 1/pi^2 S_2, C_4 = 1/pi^4 S_6, "and" C_6 =  1/pi^6 S_6$.

The $S_2$ factor of the $C_2$ coefficient is the sum of reciprocal squares that we're aiming to compute, i.e.,

$ S_2 = sum_(n=1)^oo 1/n^2 . $

The $S_4$ and $S_6$ sums are more complicated, involving double and triple sums respectively,
but since we're only interested in the $S_2$ sum, we won't need $S_4$ and $S_6$.

#pagebreak()

Rewriting the @exp:foil_infinite[expression] using the coefficients $C_2, C_4, "and" C_6$ defined earlier, we get

$
1 -
x^2 C_2 +
x^4 C_4 -
x^6 C_6 +
dots.c .
$

Per @eq:weierstrass, this sum is equal to $(sin x)/x$, so we have

$
(sin x)/x =
1 -
x^2 C_2 +
x^4 C_4 -
x^6 C_6 +
dots.c .
$ <eq:sum_of_sums>

Recalling the Maclaurin series for sine from @eq:maclaurin_series_for_sin and dividing both sides by $x$ we get

$ (sin x)/x = 1 - x^2/3! + x^4/5! - x^6/7! + dots.c . $ <eq:maclaurin_series_for_sin_over_x>

Now we have two representations of $(sin x)/x$.

Equating the coefficients of the $x^2$ terms from @eq:sum_of_sums and @eq:maclaurin_series_for_sin_over_x we get

$ C_2 = 1/3! . $

Rewriting $C_2$ and $S_2$, we get

$ 1/pi^2 S_2 = 1/3! $
$ 1/pi^2 sum_(n=1)^oo 1/n^2 = 1/3! $
$ sum_(n=1)^oo 1/n^2 = pi^2/3! . $

This completes the proof.

= Using Euler's method to prove a related theorem <sec:similar_theorem>

It is instructive to look at Euler's method applied to the $x^4$ terms of the
Maclaurin series and the Weierstrass factorization of the sine function
in order to prove the following theorem.

#theorem(title: "Basel variant")[$ sum_(m=1)^oo sum_(n=m+1)^oo 1/(m^2n^2) = pi^4/120 $] <thm:basel_variant>

The proof offers a glimpse of how Euler's method may be generalized to compute the values of sums that are similar to Basel sum.

#pagebreak()

== Proof

We begin by recalling @eq:weierstrass, which as noted earlier is a form of Weierstrass's factorization of sine,

#restate(<eq:weierstrass>)

We are interested in the $x^4$ terms in the expansion of the right-hand side of @eq:weierstrass.
These terms can only arise from the multiplication of pairs of factors containing $x^2$ terms.
Let's expand a simpler product with just four factors to see if we can observe a pattern.

$
(1 - a x^2)(1 - b x^2)(1 - c x^2)(1 - d x^2) \
= (1 - a x^2 - b x^2 + a b x^4)(1 - c x^2)(1 - d x^2) \
= (1 - a x^2 - b x^2 + a b x^4 - c x^2 + a c x^4 + b c x^4 - a b c x^6)(1 - d x^2) \
= 1 - a x^2 - b x^2 + a b x^4 - c x^2 + a c x^4 + b c x^4 - a b c x^6 \
    - d x^2 + a d x^4 + b d x^4 - a b d x^6 + c d x^4 - a c d x^6 - b c d x^6 + a b c d x^8
$ <exp:initial_expansion>

Regrouping the 16 terms of @exp:initial_expansion[expression] we get

$
& 1 & wide binom(4,0) = 1 "term " \ 
& - a x^2 - b x^2  - c x^2 - d x^2 & wide binom(4,1) = 4 "terms"  \
& + a b x^4 + a c x^4 + b c x^4 + a d x^4 + b d x^4  + c d x^4 & wide binom(4,2) = 6 "terms" \
& - a b c x^6 - a b d x^6 - a c d x^6 - b c d x^6 & wide binom(4,3) = 4 "terms" \
& + a b c d x^8 & wide binom(4,4) = 1 "term."
$ <exp:full_expansion>

We note that the coefficients of the $x^4$ terms in @exp:full_expansion[expression] are the products of every #box([_2-combination_])
drawn from the set of coefficients of the $x^2$ terms, ${a,b,c,d}$.
That is, they are the products of every possible pair drawn from ${a,b,c,d}$ where the order does not matter and there are no repeats.

Translating this pattern to the situation in @eq:weierstrass, where the coefficients of the $x^2$ terms have the form $1/(k^2pi^2)$,
we need to sum the products of every possible pair of reciprocal square coefficients,
such that the order does not matter and there are no repeats.

#pagebreak()

To get the required sum of products, we'll need two indexes, say $m$ and $n$, with appropriate constraints applied so that we have

$ sum_(m=1)^oo sum_(n=m+1)^oo 1/(m^2 pi^2) x^2 1/(n^2 pi^2) x^2 . $ <exp:sum_of_reciprocal_products>

Here, for each $m$ we run through every $n$ that is greater than $m$.
Another option would be to run through every $n$ less than $m$, but in that case we would have to start $m$ at 2.
Ultimately, it doesn't matter which indexing scheme we choose as long as $m != n$ and that either $m < n$ or $m > n$, but not both.
Rewriting @exp:sum_of_reciprocal_products[expression], we get

$ x^4/pi^4 sum_(m=1)^oo sum_(n=m+1)^oo 1/(m^2 n^2) . $ <exp:sum_of_reciprocal_products_final>

Recalling @eq:maclaurin_series_for_sin_over_x, we have

#restate(<eq:maclaurin_series_for_sin_over_x>)

We can equate the coefficient of the $x^4$ term in the Maclaurin series on the right-hand side of @eq:maclaurin_series_for_sin_over_x
with the coefficient of the $x^4$ term in @exp:sum_of_reciprocal_products_final[expression] to get

$ 1/pi^4 sum_(m=1)^oo sum_(n=m+1)^oo 1/(m^2 n^2) = 1/5! . $

Rewriting leads to the following statement which completes the proof.

$ sum_(m=1)^oo sum_(n=m+1)^oo 1/(m^2 n^2) = pi^4/5! $

= Evaluating the 4-series

Armed with the previous results, we can easily evaluate the 4-series.

#theorem(title: "Sum of the 4-series")[$ sum_(n=1)^oo 1/(n^4) = pi^4/90 $] <thm:sum_of_4-series>

== Proof

We begin by using the Basel sum to evaluate the double sum

$ sum_(m=1)^oo sum_(n=1)^oo 1/(m^2 n^2) , $ <exp:double_sum_reciprocal_product_squares>

which is the sum of all reciprocals of the product of two squares of a natural number greater than zero.
Note that this double sum is different from the one in @thm:basel_variant[theorem] because here the indexes are _unrestricted_,
that is, $n$ does not depend on $m$.

Clearly, we can rewrite the double sum as

$ sum_(m=1)^oo sum_(n=1)^oo 1/m^2 1/n^2 . $

And, since the $1/m^2$ term is not captured by the $n$ index of the inner sum, we can move it outside the inner sum to get

$ sum_(m=1)^oo (1/m^2 sum_(n=1)^oo 1/n^2) . $

Now in @thm:basel_problem[theorem], the Basel problem theorem, we showed that the Basel sum, $sum_(n=1)^oo 1/n^2$, converges to $pi^2/6$,
so it is effectively just a constant multiplying each $1/m^2$ term, and thus by the distributive property, we can move it outside the outer sum to get

$ sum_(n=1)^oo 1/n^2 dot sum_(m=1)^oo 1/m^2 . $

In fact, this is a general result, so that we can always rewrite the double sum of a product as the product of a sum, provided that the two series are convergent.

Finally, since we know that both series in the product evaluate to $pi^2/6$, we have

$ sum_(m=1)^oo sum_(n=1)^oo 1/(m^2 n^2) = pi^4/36 . $ <eq:double_sum_reciprocal_product_squares>

#figure(number-array, caption: [Sum of reciprocal product squares]) <fig:reciprocal-product-of-squares>

Observe that the sum of the terms in upper triangle, highlighted in yellow, is the sum of @thm:basel_variant[theorem], that is, $pi^4/120$,
and by symmetry the sum of the terms in the lower triangle, highlighted in green, has the the same value, also $pi^4/120$.

The terms along the major diagonal, highlighted in pink, satisfy $m=n$.
Thus the sum of the terms along the major diagonal is

$ sum_(n=1)^oo 1/(n^2 n^2) = sum_(n=1)^oo 1/n^4  , $

which is the series we are looking to evaluate.

To compute the sum of the terms along the major diagonal we can subtract the sums of the upper and lower triangles, each $pi^4/120$,
from the sum of all terms in the table, which we already showed in @eq:double_sum_reciprocal_product_squares is equal to $pi^4/36$.

Thus we have

$ sum_(n=1)^oo 1/n^4 =  pi^4/36 - 2pi^4/120 = 10pi^4/360 - 6pi^4/360 = 4pi^4/360 = pi^4/90 , $

which concludes the proof.

= Conclusion <sec:conclusion>

Euler's remarkable insight in solving the Basel problem was recognizing that the coefficients of like terms could be equated
from two different representations of the function $(sin x)/x$.
The Maclaurin series representation of sine was well known at the time of Euler's work.
However, to establish a second representation of $(sin x)/x$, Euler assumed that sine could be expressed
as an infinite product.
His assumption anticipated Weierstrass's factorization theorem published in 1876 as part of a work on the theory of analytic functions.
As noted in the introduction, Euler's method was an important step towards understanding p-series in general,
and in particular can be used to compute the values of all p-series where p is a non-zero even natural number.
Although many tests exist that determine whether a series converges or diverges,
explicitly calculating the value of a series is often challenging.
Euler's method therefore is a significant contribution to mathematics
because it provides a tool for evaluating a whole class of p-series and related infinite series.
